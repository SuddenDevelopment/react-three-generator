# react-three-generator

# goals

- Create a component system for procedurally generated elements for React Three Fiber
- Textures can be used as inputs. where black = 0 and white = 1
- Textures values are referenced to spawn objects given a specific min-max = object
- Objects remove when not in view of the camera for speed
- New objects spawn as the camera approaches
- Objects to spawn can be libraries that generate objects procedurally from components
- All of the above can be built in layers
